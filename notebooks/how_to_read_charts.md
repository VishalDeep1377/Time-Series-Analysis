# How to Read the Charts

This guide will help you understand the key charts and indicators in the Stock Analysis & Forecasting app.

## 1. Close Price with SMA & EMA
- **SMA (Simple Moving Average):** Shows the average price over a set period. Helps spot trends.
- **EMA (Exponential Moving Average):** Like SMA, but gives more weight to recent prices.
- **How to use:**
  - When the price crosses above the SMA/EMA, it may signal an uptrend (buy).
  - When the price crosses below, it may signal a downtrend (sell).

## 2. RSI (Relative Strength Index)
- **RSI:** Measures if a stock is overbought or oversold (scale 0-100).
- **How to use:**
  - RSI above 70: Stock may be overbought (could decrease soon).
  - RSI below 30: Stock may be oversold (could increase soon).

## 3. MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
- **MACD:** Shows the relationship between two moving averages.
- **How to use:**
  - MACD crossing above the signal line: Possible uptrend (buy).
  - MACD crossing below: Possible downtrend (sell).

## 4. Bollinger Bands
- **Bollinger Bands:** Show price volatility using upper and lower bands.
- **How to use:**
  - Price touching upper band: Stock may be overbought.
  - Price touching lower band: Stock may be oversold.
  - Wide bands: High volatility. Narrow bands: Low volatility.

## 5. Volatility (20-day Rolling Std Dev)
- **Volatility:** Measures how much the price moves.
- **How to use:**
  - High volatility = bigger price swings (riskier).
  - Low volatility = more stable price.
